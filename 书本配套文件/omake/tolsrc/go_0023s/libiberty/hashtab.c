/* This package implements basic hash table functionality.  It is possible
   to search for an entry, create an entry and destroy an entry.

   Elements in the table are generic pointers.

   The size of the table is not fixed; if the occupancy of the table
   grows too high the hash table will be expanded.

   The abstract data implementation is based on generalized Algorithm D
   from Knuth's book "The art of computer programming".  Hash table is
   expanded by creation of new hash table and transferring elements from
   the old table to the new table. */

   I got it by extracting all the identifiers from all the source code
   I had lying around in mid-1999, and testing many recurrences of
   the form "H_n = H_{n-1} * K + c_n * L + M" where K, L, M were either
   prime numbers or the appropriate identity.  This was the best one.
   I don't remember exactly what constituted "best", except I was
   looking at bucket-length distributions mostly.
   
   So it should be very good at hashing identifiers, but might not be
   as good at arbitrary strings.
   
   I'll add that it thoroughly trounces the hash functions recommended
   for this use at http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/index.html, both
   on speed and bucket distribution.  I haven't tried it against the
   function they just started using for Perl's hashes.  */
