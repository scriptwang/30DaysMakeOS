   from the base class, the new virtual function is placed into
   the virtual function table at exactly the same address that
   it had in the base class.  When this is extended to multiple
   inheritance, the same thing happens, except that multiple virtual
   function tables must be maintained.  The first virtual function
   table is treated in exactly the same way as in the case of single

  /* Here's what the standard says:
     
       [over.over]

       If the name is a function template, template argument deduction
       is done, and if the argument deduction succeeds, the deduced
       arguments are used to generate a single template function, which
       is added to the set of overloaded functions considered.

       Non-member functions and static member functions match targets of
       type "pointer-to-function" or "reference-to-function."  Nonstatic
       member functions match targets of type "pointer-to-member
       function;" the function type of the pointer to member is used to
       select the member function from the set of overloaded member
       functions.  If a nonstatic member function is selected, the
       reference to the overloaded function name is required to have the
       form of a pointer to member as described in 5.3.1.

       If more than one function is selected, any template functions in
       the set are eliminated if the set also contains a non-template
       function, and any given template function is eliminated if the
       set contains a second template function that is more specialized
       than the first according to the partial ordering rules 14.5.5.2.
       After such eliminations, if any, there shall remain exactly one
       selected function.  */
