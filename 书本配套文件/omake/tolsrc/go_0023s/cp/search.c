   When we are done with the decl-specifier-seq, we record the lookups we've

   When we process the first declarator, either in parse_decl or
     begin_function_definition, we call save_type_access_control,
     which stores the lookups from the decl-specifier-seq in
     current_type_lookups.
   As we finish with each declarator, we process everything in type_lookups
     via decl_type_access_control, which resets type_lookups to the value of
     current_type_lookups for subsequent declarators.
