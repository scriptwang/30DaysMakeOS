/* Build a C++ vector delete expression.
   MAXINDEX is the number of elements to be deleted.
   ELT_SIZE is the nominal size of each element in the vector.
   BASE is the expression that should yield the store to be deleted.
   This function expands (or synthesizes) these calls itself.
   AUTO_DELETE_VEC says whether the container (vector) should be deallocated.

   This also calls delete for virtual baseclasses of elements of the vector.

   Update: MAXINDEX is no longer needed.  The size can be extracted from the
   start of the vector for pointers, and from the type for arrays.  We still
   use MAXINDEX for arrays because it happens to already have one of the
   values we'd have to extract.  (We could use MAXINDEX with pointers to
   confirm the size, and trap if the numbers differ; not clear that it'd
   be worth bothering.)  */
