   TODO:

   (1) Consider:

		if (p) goto A;		// predict taken
		foo ();
	      A:
		if (q) goto B;		// predict taken
		bar ();
	      B:
		baz ();
		return;

       We'll currently reorder this as

		if (!p) goto C;
	      A:
		if (!q) goto D;
	      B:
		baz ();
		return;
	      D:
		bar ();
		goto B;
	      C:
		foo ();
		goto A;

       A better ordering is

		if (!p) goto C;
		if (!q) goto D;
	      B:
		baz ();
		return;
	      C:
		foo ();
		if (q) goto B;
	      D:
		bar ();
		goto B;

       This requires that we be able to duplicate the jump at A, and
       adjust the graph traversal such that greedy placement doesn't
       fix D before C is considered.

   (2) Coordinate with shorten_branches to minimize the number of
       long branches.

   (3) Invent a method by which sufficiently non-predicted code can
       be moved to either the end of the section or another section
       entirely.  Some sort of NOTE_INSN note would work fine.

       This completely scroggs all debugging formats, so the user
       would have to explicitly ask for it.
