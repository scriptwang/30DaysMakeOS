/* This file contains optimizer of the control flow.  The main entrypoint is
   cleanup_cfg.  Following optimizations are performed:

   - Unreachable blocks removal
   - Edge forwarding (edge to the forwarder block is forwarded to it's
     successor.  Simplification of the branch instruction is performed by
     underlying infrastructure so branch can be converted to simplejump or
     eliminated).
   - Cross jumping (tail merging)
   - Conditional jump-around-simplejump simplification
   - Basic block merging.  */
