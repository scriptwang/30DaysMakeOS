	 TYPE_NAME of this brand new (duplicate) ..._TYPE node.

	 The whole point here is to end up with a situation where each
	 and every ..._TYPE node the compiler creates will be uniquely
	 associated with AT MOST one node representing a typedef name.
	 This way, even though the compiler substitutes corresponding
	 ..._TYPE nodes for TYPE_DECL (i.e. "typedef name") nodes very
	 early on, later parts of the compiler can always do the reverse
	 translation and get back the corresponding typedef name.  For
	 example, given:

		typedef struct S MY_TYPE;
		MY_TYPE object;

	 Later parts of the compiler might only know that `object' was of
	 type `struct S' if it were not for code just below.  With this
	 code however, later parts of the compiler see something like:

		struct S' == struct S
		typedef struct S' MY_TYPE;
		struct S' object;

	 And they can then deduce (from the node for type struct S') that
	 the original object declaration was:

		MY_TYPE object;

	 Being able to do this is important for proper support of protoize,
	 and also for generating precise symbolic debugging information
	 which takes full account of the programmer's (typedef) vocabulary.

         Obviously, we don't want to generate a duplicate ..._TYPE node if
	 the TYPE_DECL node that we are now processing really represents a
	 standard built-in type.

         Since all standard types are effectively declared at line zero
         in the source file, we can easily check to see if we are working
         on a standard type by checking the current value of lineno.  */

   DECLSPECS is a chain of tree_list nodes whose value fields
    are the storage classes and type specifiers.

   DECL_CONTEXT says which syntactic context this declaration is in:
     NORMAL for most contexts.  Make a VAR_DECL or FUNCTION_DECL or TYPE_DECL.
     FUNCDEF for a function definition.  Like NORMAL but a few different
      error messages in each case.  Return value may be zero meaning
      this definition is too screwy to try to parse.
     PARM for a parameter declaration (either within a function prototype
      or before a function body).  Make a PARM_DECL, or return void_type_node.
     TYPENAME if for a typename (in a cast or sizeof).
      Don't make a DECL node; just return the ..._TYPE node.
     FIELD for a struct or union field; make a FIELD_DECL.
     BITFIELD for a field with specified width.
   INITIALIZED is 1 if the decl has an initializer.

   In the TYPENAME case, DECLARATOR is really an absolute declarator.
   It may also be so in the PARM case, for a prototype where the
   argument type is specified but not the name.

   This function is where the complicated C meanings of `static'
